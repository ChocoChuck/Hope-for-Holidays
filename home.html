 <p>Kids Can Achieve is an organization with the future in mind. That future being the youth of America. Our main goal is to give opportunities to less fotunate children and provide programs to help them achieve goals for a prosperous future.</p> 


<p>Originating in 1995, our main goal is to provide a service for those in need of better education, activities after school and weekends, field trips for learning as well as enjoyment. We've taken an intrest in children who live in orphanages, one parent homes, foster homes or those who may live in poverty stricken areas. It's already rough living in the certain conditions and the stress from it carries into the everyday life of a child. We try to relieve a lot of that stress by keeping them focused on learning while taking full advantage of what we have to offer.</p>


 <p>With our programs we've been able to see most of our past alum go on to graduate high school and college, some have gone to trade schools and now hold down very successful positions as well as a few making it into professional sports. We stay hands on with all of our kids through out their time with us. Even when they leave us we keep in touch because they are part of our family.</p>


 <p>Some of the kids who have finished and are now adults are also now mentors, tutors and work within the company to help the newbies that come into the program. Most say they wanted to become mentors or tutors because this is their way of giving back and saying thank you for helping them achieve their goals and hopefully they can help a few along the way as well.</p>



<p>This is a charity based company. We do not charge for programs becuase we know that it's difficult out there to gather money for tutors, trips, sporting programs, etc. We have been lucky to be able to continue to be an organization that provides free programs. We work hard everyday to reach out to companies and other organizations to donate whatever they can to help us continue to stick to the standards we are used to providing.</p>



<p>We want your child to be the best person he or she can be. We want what's best for them. We want a bright future because they are the future and if you take care of the future, the future has a chance for survival. And that's all anyone wants is a chance. We would love for your child to be a part of our ever growing extended family.</p>
